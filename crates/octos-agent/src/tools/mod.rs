//! Tool framework for agent tool execution.
//!
//! # Typed `ToolContext` migration (M8.1)
//!
//! Tools receive execution context through [`ToolContext`]. Historically the
//! context was delivered indirectly via the [`TOOL_CTX`] task-local, which the
//! executor populated before calling each tool's [`Tool::execute`]. That works
//! but makes the carrier invisible at the trait surface, so tools that want a
//! field must either read the task-local or reach into globals.
//!
//! M8.1 introduces [`Tool::execute_with_context`], a typed entry point that
//! threads `&ToolContext` explicitly. To keep the migration additive:
//!
//! - The trait's default implementation of `execute_with_context` falls back
//!   to the legacy [`Tool::execute`]. Existing tools keep working unchanged.
//! - Migrated tools override `execute_with_context` and use the typed record.
//!   Their `execute` impl simply re-enters `execute_with_context` with a
//!   zero-value context so out-of-band callers (tests, integrations that have
//!   not been updated) still get predictable behaviour.
//! - [`ToolContext`] carries the legacy fields *plus* placeholder stubs for
//!   future milestones: [`AgentDefinitions`], [`ToolPermissions`],
//!   [`FileStateCache`] (populated in M8.4), [`Notifications`], and
//!   [`AppStateHandle`]. Each stub is annotated with the future issue that
//!   will populate it. They all have cheap zero-value constructors so today's
//!   executor can build a context without wiring.
//!
//! The executor still sets [`TOOL_CTX`] for legacy plugin tools that rely on
//! the task-local read path (see `plugins/tool.rs`). Once every tool is
//! migrated the task-local becomes redundant and can be retired, but that
//! clean-up is out of scope for M8.1.

/// - `pf/<base64>` / `pf/<base64>/<display>` profile-handle short-circuit

/// - absolute paths inside upload tmpdir, workspace, or profile root
/// - bare basenames that exist under the upload tmpdir
/// - workspace-relative paths (with `..` traversal rejected)
